# WeiBo-Tools
Tools for analyzing and managing Weibo accounts

I believe that personal data should not be stored on platforms that are beyond our control, 
especially when the platform may process your data in unknown ways.

The purpose of this project is to extract some necessary Weibo data locally, and after analysis or organization, 
facilitate data archiving and processing (classification, deletion, backup, etc.).
